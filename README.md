# Scrabble-Rating-Prediction
Kaggle Competition - Predictive Modeling

This project repository is created in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Predictive Analytics course offered by the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota.

In this project, based on Woogle.io datasets we are tasked with finding the rating of human players before a game is played. The dataset includes 72773 games played by three bots on Woogles.io BetterBot (beginner), STEEBot (intermediate), and HastyBot (advanced). The games are between the bots and human users. We will be using metadata about the games and specific information about the turns in each game to predict the rating of the human opponents. The rating provided by our model will be evaluated by RMSE.  

The complete project report and video presentation are included in this repository.
